# Build and Deploy a Modern Crypto Exchange Uniswap dApp

## Introduction

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by allowing users to trade tokens without relying on centralized intermediaries. Uniswap is one of the leading decentralized exchanges built on Ethereum, utilizing automated liquidity pools and smart contracts.

## Setup

1. Node.js and npm.
2. React.js project for the frontend.
3. Initialize a new Ethereum project for smart contract development.

## Smart Contract Development

Develop smart contracts to handle token swaps and liquidity pools:

1. Create a token contract representing ERC-20 tokens.
2. Implement a Uniswap-like exchange contract for token swaps and liquidity provision.
3. Write tests to ensure the functionality of your smart contracts.

## Frontend Development

Build the frontend interface for your dApp using React.js:

1. Design and develop a user-friendly interface for token swaps.
2. Integrate Web3.js for interacting with Ethereum and smart contracts.
3. Implement functionalities such as token swapping, liquidity provision, and view transaction history.

## Deploying the dApp

Deploy smart contracts and frontend to a testnet or mainnet:

1. Set up a development environment for Ethereum deployment.
2. Deploy your smart contracts to a testnet (e.g., Polygon mumbai, Rinkeby).
3. Host frontend application on a web server (e.g., GitHub Pages).
4. Test dApp by performing token swaps and liquidity provision.
